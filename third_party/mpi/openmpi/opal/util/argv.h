   * it is permissable to pass a string on the stack as the str
   * argument to this function.
   *
   * To add the first entry to an argv array, call this function with
   * (*argv == NULL).  This function will allocate an array of length
   * 2; the first entry will point to a copy of the string passed in
   * arg, the second entry will be set to NULL.
   *
   * If (*argv != NULL), it will be realloc'ed to be 1 (char*) larger,
   * and the next-to-last entry will point to a copy of the string
   * passed in arg.  The last entry will be set to NULL.
   *
   * Just to reinforce what was stated above: the string is copied by
   * value into the argv array; there is no need to keep the original
   * string (i.e., the arg parameter) after invoking this function.
