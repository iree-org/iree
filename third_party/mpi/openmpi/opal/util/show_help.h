 *
 * The "show help" subsystem (SHS) in Open MPI is intended to help the
 * developer convey meaningful information to the user (read longer
 * than is convenient in a single printf), particularly when errors
 * occur.  The SHS allows the storage of arbitrary-length help
 * messages in text files which can be parameterized by text filename,
 * message name, POSIX locale, and printf()-style parameters (e.g.,
 * "%s", "%d", etc.).  Note that the primary purpose of the SHS is to
 * display help messages, but it can actually be used to display any
 * arbitrary text messages.
 *
 * The function opal_show_help() is used to find a help message and
 * display it.  Its important parameters are a filename, message name,
 * and printf()-style varargs parameters used to substitute into the
 * message.
 *
 * It was originally intended that this system would support a very
 * simple version of i18n-like support, but we got (strong) feedback
 * that i18n support was not desired.  So it never happened.
 *
 * As such, the file lookup is quite straightforward -- the caller
 * passes in the filename to find the help message, and the SHS looks
 * for that file in $pkgdatadir (typically $prefix/share/openmpi).
 *
 * Once the file is successfully opened, the SHS looks for the
 * appropriate help message to display.  It looks for the message name
 * in the file, reads in the message, and displays it.  printf()-like
 * substitutions are performed (e.g., %d, %s, etc.) --
 * opal_show_help() takes a variable legnth argument list that are
 * used for these substitutions.
 *
 * The format of the help file is simplistic:
 *
 * - Comments begin with #.  Any characters after a # on a line are
 *   ignored.  It is not possible to escape a #.
 * - Message names are on a line by themselves and marked with [].
 *   Names can be any ASCII string within the [] (excluding the
 *   characters newline, linefeed, [, ], and #).
 * - Messages are any characters between message names and/or the end
 *   of the file.
 *
 * Here's a sample helpfile:
 *
 * \verbatimbegin
 * # This is a comment.
 * [topic 1]
 * Here's the first message.  Let's substitute in an integer: %d.
 * The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy %s.
 * # This is another comment -- it's not displayed in the first message.
 * [another:topic:foo:foo:foo]
 * This is the second message.  Let's just keep rolling along to get
 * to the second line in the message for this example.
 * \verbatimend
 *
 * It is expected that help messages will be grouped by filename;
 * similar messages should be in a single file.  For example, an MCA
 * component may install its own helpfile in Open MPI's $pkgdatadir,
 * and therefore the component can invoke opal_show_help() to display
 * its own help messages.
 *
 * Message files in $pkgdatadir have a naming convention: they
 * generally start with the prefix "help-" and are followed by a name
 * descriptive of what kind of messages they contain.  MCA components
 * should generally abide by the MCA prefix rule, with the exception
 * that they should start the filename with "help-", as mentioned
 * previously.
