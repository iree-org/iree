In this case, a general purpose, mixed precision mmt4d op is defined via a high level description directly in the compiler and is then available to both users of the compiler (as a <code>linalg.mmt4d</code> op) or for direct emission via Python based IR construction (i.e. for direct integration into high level frameworks without rebuilding the compiler). The ability to define such new special forms cheaply, and without any systemic framework level cost, is part of the extensibility and composition story that we expect will become increasingly important in development and deployment scenarios in the future, and in this case, it let us spring board off of high quality code generation which was already well integrated and composed well with other features of the compiler.</p>","tags":["CPU"]},{"location":"community/blog/2021-10-13-matrix-multiplication-with-mmt4d/#existing-matrix-multplication-code-generation","title":"Existing Matrix Multplication Code Generation","text":"<p>Let us start by discussing IREE\u2019s existing matmul code generation and highlight the issues that <code>mmt4d</code> aims to overcome.</p> <p>The existing approach operates in-place on the source matrices. When we discuss \"tiling\" in this paragraph, we refer exclusively to the traversal \u2014 how these source matrices are traversed by the matmul loop. There is no \"tiled layout\" here, which will be the key difference with <code>mmt4d</code> below.</p> <p>The destination matrix is tiled into workgroups (CPU threads) tiles, then each workgroup tile is tiled to fit some level of CPU cache, and finally each tile is further tiled to fit target architecture registers (e.g. 8x8).</p> <p>That multi-level tiling means that the code works like the following loop nest:</p> <pre><code>def tiled_matmul(A, B, C, tile_m, tile_n, tile_k, tile_m_v, tile_n_v, tile_k_v):\n m = A.shape[0]\n k = A.shape[1]\n n = B.shape[1]\n for m1 in range(0, m, tile_m):\n   for n1 in range(0, n, tile_n):\n     for k1 in range(0, k, tile_k):\n       # First level of tiling views...\n       lhs_tile = A[m1:m1+tile_m, k1:k1+tile_k]\n       rhs_tile = B[k1:k1+tile_k, n1:n1+tile_n]\n       dst_tile = C[m1:m1+tile_m, n1:n1+tile_n]\n       for mv in range(0, tile_m, tile_m_v):\n         for nv in range(0, tile_n, tile_n_v):\n           for kv in range(0, tile_k, tile_k_v):\n             # Register tiling views...\n             lhs_tile_v = lhs_tile[mv:mv+tile_m_v, kv:kv+tile_k_v]\n             rhs_tile_v = rhs_tile[kv:kv+tile_k_v, nv:nv+tile_n_v]\n             # kernel.\n             dst_tile[mv:mv+tile_m_v, nv:nv+tile_n_v] += np.matmul(lhs_tile_v, rhs_tile_v)\n return C\n</code></pre> <p>The two main problems with this approach are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Overhead to meet SIMD ISA layout requirements: In practice, the kernel     needs to use specific SIMD     instructions to perform the arithmetic. They expect small tiles of the     matrices to be loaded in registers, in a specific layout. If the matrix data     wasn't already stored in memory in such a tiled layout, then the kernel has     to perform such a data rearrangement on the fly, incurring substantial     overhead. For NxN matrix multiplication, the kernel performs     O(N<sup>3</sup>) work on O(N<sup>2</sup>) data, so doing that rearrangement     there means O(N<sup>3</sup>) overhead where O(N<sup>2</sup>) should have     sufficed, as this could have been done as a pre-processing step on     O(N<sup>2</sup>) data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inefficent memory traversal: For efficiency reasons, we always need     <code>tile_m_v&gt;1</code> and <code>tile_n_v&gt;1</code>. That is because the higher these values, the     fewer memory-load instructions are needed overall; and this is also dictated     by the SIMD instructions that we want to use. But that means that the kernel     is accessing simultaneously multiple rows or columns of the left-hand and     right-hand side matrices. And in this existing approach, they are stored in     linear layout, not in a tiled layout, so these accesses are not contiguous     in memory. This is detrimental to memory access performance, meaning the     CPU caches, in multiple ways. One     is that these multiple non-contiguous accesses may alias each other in the     L1 cache because of low     associativity.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["CPU"]},{"location":"community/blog/2021-10-13-matrix-multiplication-with-mmt4d/#matrix-multiplication-operation-with-4d-tiled-operands","title":"Matrix Multiplication Operation With 4D Tiled Operands","text":"<p>For the reasons above, an efficient matmul implementation must reorder data into a tiled layout matching the target SIMD ISA and making the memory access patterns as contiguous as possible.</p> <p>IREE/MLIR defaults to bufferizing all tensors into a \"row-major\" order, meaning that the last-enumerated dimension is the one that is contiguous in memory. As we prefer not to write custom bufferization code, we can't specify an alternative layout for a tensor. Fortunately, it is possible to represent a 2D tiled layout as a 4D layout. For example, <code>tensor&lt;2x2x2x2xf32&gt;</code> can represent a 4x4 matrix made of 2x2 tiles, each of which is 2x2. The row-major layout on <code>tensor&lt;2x2x2x2xf32&gt;</code> makes each 2x2 tile contiguous and row-major, and arranges the 2x2 tiles themselves into a row-major 2x2 layout in the overall 4x4 matrix.</p> <p>Such a row-major-tiled layout is exactly what we need for the left-hand side of a matrix multiplication, because matrix multiplication traverses the left-hand side matrix row by row. But for the right-hand side matrix, we want a column-major-tiled layout. To solve this problem, we decide to implement not matrix multiplication, but matrix-multiplication-by-transposed-right-hand-side which is where the <code>t</code> in the <code>linalg.mmt4d</code> came from. Now such an op is happy with both the left and right-hand sides being row-major-tiled.</p> <p>The following example illustrates that. In these diagrams, each matrix element is rendered its memory offset.</p> <p></p> <p>To compute the 2x2 block in the destination matrix, we will have to load two yellow blocks from LHS, RHS matrices respectively compute their matmul results (i.e. call the kernel), then the two blue blocks, and so on. As we can see, each tile loads data that is not contiguous. It would be better if we rearranged the elements in the following layout:</p> <p></p> <p>Now tiles are stored contiguously in memory and the kernel can simply load them from memory into the registers that will be directly consumed by the SIMD instructions performing the multiplications. Moreover, the kernel is now loading from just two contiguous data streams, a simple memory access pattern which is sure to be efficient (regarding caches, etc) on any reasonable target hardware.</p> <p>We introduce a <code>linalg.mmt4d</code> operation that performs such a matrix multiplication on matrices in a tiled layout represented as 4D tensors. That leaves the question of how to represent, within the linalg dialect, the conversions between ordinary matrices represented as 2D tensors, and these tiled matrices represented as 4D tensors. Moreover, these conversions should be tileable and decompose well. Thankfully, the transformation from 2D to 4D can be written as a reshape followed by a transpose as in the following digram:</p> <p></p> <p>So we can think of the outermost two dimensions of the 4D representations as the tile position in the overall matrix, and the innermost two as the element position within one tile. Hopefully the following Python pseudocode makes it more concrete:</p> <pre><code>def pack_2d_4d(operand, parallel_size, reduction_size):\n i1 = operand.shape[0] // parallel_size # M1\n i2 = parallel_size    # M0\n j1 = operand.shape[1] // reduction_size # K1\n j2 = reduction_size   # K0\n operand_4d = np.reshape(operand, [i1, i2, j1, j2])\n return np.transpose(operand_4d, [0, 2, 1, 3]) # [M1, K1, M0, K0]\n</code></pre> <p>Now the mmt4d operation will follow a structure as the multi level tiling, for simplicity we considered the case here where no L1 tiling is required only first level of distribution to workgroups:</p> <pre><code>def mmt4d(A, B, C, M0, N0, K0):\n M = A.shape[0]\n N = B.shape[1]\n Bt = np.transpose(B, [1, 0])\n A4d = pack_2d_4d(A, M0, K0)\n Bt4d = pack_2d_4d(Bt, N0, K0)\n M1 = A4d.shape[0]\n N1 = Bt4d.shape[0]\n K1 = A4d.shape[1]\n for m1 in range(0, M1):\n   for n1 in range(0, N1):\n     for k1 in range(0, K1):\n       # Tile views that are contiguous in memory.\n       lhs_tile = np.reshape(A4d[m1, k1, :, :], [M0, K0])\n       rhs_tile = np.reshape(Bt4d[n1, k1, :, :], [N0, K0])\n       # Inner kernel.\n       C[m1, n1, :, :] += np.matmul(lhs_tile, np.transpose(rhs_tile, [1, 0]))\n # 4d -&gt; 2D\n C2d = unpack_4d_2d(C)\n return C2d\n</code></pre> <p>The resulting 4D tiled matrix still needs be rearranged back to the original layout as 2D tensor:</p> <pre><code>def unpack_4d_2d(operand):\n i1 = operand.shape[0] # M1\n j1 = operand.shape[1] # N1\n i2 = operand.shape[2] # M0\n j2 = operand.shape[3] # N0\n operand_transposed = operand.transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # [M1, M0, N1, N0]\n return operand_transposed.reshape([i1 * i2, j1 * j2]) # [M, N]\n</code></pre>","tags":["CPU"]},{"location":"community/blog/2021-10-13-matrix-multiplication-with-mmt4d/#performance-results","title":"Performance Results","text":"<p>We benchmarked various float32 matmul problems of different sizes and the result showed that mmt4d is faster than the existing matmul implementation for bigger matrices as we can see the in the following chart:</p> <p></p> <p>The SIMD instruction being used here is the simplest kind, a <code>vector*scalar</code> multiplication, and the storage orders of the matrices allow the existing implementation to directly load the vectors from the source matrices without any rearrangement overhead.

Users are the only ones who can determine the tradeoffs they are willing to accept: for example, the mechanism to extend device code with a custom runtime call to a C function does not work on GPUs and gets significantly more complicated on CPUs as sandboxes/enclaves are used - but if the user scenario is for local process CPU-only execution that may not matter.</p>","tags":["JAX","PyTorch","TensorFlow"]},{"location":"reference/extensions/#where-to-extend-inputscompilerruntime","title":"Where to extend (inputs/compiler/runtime)","text":"<p>Consider in normal software development when one would choose to write more code (possibly packaging it into a reusable library) vs. changing the programming language or compiler they are using to compile their code vs. changing the operating systems their code runs on.

MLIR value-semantic tensors are used as the primary data type to allow SSA use-def to provide a bulk of the infrastructure required to perform the computation partitioning and outlining.</p> <p>The dialect is designed to ingest relatively high-level linear algebra via XLA HLO ops (that also operate on the value-semantic tensor types) and optionally MLIR standard ops for control flow and other actions. After conversion of any higher-level ops that have special semantics in the flow dialect, such as global variables, the rest are partitioned into regions containing simple and compatible computations. Finally, outlining moves the computations into executables and leaves only the execution flow encoded via dispatch operations.</p> <p>The primary unit of interest is a \"dispatch region\" containing compatible computations that can be scheduled together efficiently (and safely). \"Compatible\" here is specified as similarly shaped workloads that indicate how many invocations a computation can be parallelized across when running in a SPMD execution model. Though it depends on the particular runtime backends this more concretely means things like the untiled workload (or tiled workgroups) used in GPU dispatches or similar thread pool executors.</p> <p>After identification of the dispatchable regions a set of transformations performs folding and simplification to reduce the total number of dispatches. Heuristics are used in certain cases to more efficiently schedule special ops (such as GEMM) and the design is amenable to profile- guided analysis that can be added in the future.</p> <p>The resulting outlined executable modules containing the dispatchable code can be translated to one or more backends (such as SPIR-V for Vulkan, or LLVM IR for running on the CPU, etc). The IR that is outlined is untouched and in the input format (such as XLA HLO ops) allowing conversion using any MLIR target that supports ingesting such input. A few special ops are used to communicate statically available information such as the expected workload size, shapes of inputs and outputs, etc.</p> <ul> <li>'flow' Dialect<ul> <li>Operation

Objects are declared per executable target and selected automatically during linking based on where the dispatch is used. Semantically this is equivalent to a <code>flow.dispatch.workgroups</code> but with the workgroup region invisible to the compiler. See <code>hal.executable</code> for more information about object linkage.</p> <p>Note that since this happens at tensor level the dispatch operation has value semantics: some tensors (and optionally other primitive types) are consumed and one or more new result tensors are produced. Inside each workgroup, however, the input and output tensors are available for arbitrary loads and stores. In many cases each workgroup will load some particular tile(s) from the input tensors and store some particular tile(s) to the output tensors unique to that workgroup. Though it's possible for multiple workgroups to load the same regions of the input tensors behavior is undefined if multiple workgroups store to the same regions of the output tensors. Codegen guarantees this behavior but when sourcing externally authored dispatch functions it's critical that this behavior is observed.</p> <p>Though the representation is similar to the GPU-style grid dispatch model here we still have not yet allocated buffers, determined the target device for execution, or even completed fully resolving shapes/types/etc. Because of this it's important that the workgroup body use the platform-dependent primitives for accessing workgroup ID, size, and count intrinsics instead of hardcoding them to a particular set of values. Assume that any workgroup dispatch may end up being specialized for several different target devices and even several different variants for a particular target device (differing workgroup sizes, etc). To aid deduplication code producing these external dispatches should try not to specialize early for particular shapes and instead emit the most generic code possible as having 500 slightly different <code>hal.dispatch.extern</code> ops pointing at the same object file is likely to require 500 copies of the object instead of 500 calls to the same object.</p> <p>Because at this point in the layering devices have not yet been selected the workgroup count cannot be fully evaluated. Instead workload parameters are captured that are then passed to a function that when later evaluated computes the actual workgroup count based on target information.

To this end all ops carry the symbolic size of the resources on which they operate as well as the lifetime of the resources they are acting upon. This manifests in the usage of the <code>!stream.resource</code> type:</p> <pre><code>// Unresolved lifetime (resolved during the iree-stream-refine-usage pass):\n!stream.resource&lt;*&gt;\n// An externally managed value (passed in via the program API).\n!stream.resource&lt;external&gt;\n// A staging buffer for uploads/downloads.\n!stream.resource&lt;staging&gt;\n// A short-lived value that is used across streams.\n!stream.resource&lt;transient&gt;\n// A long-lived value that persists across streams in globals.\n!stream.resource&lt;variable&gt;\n// An immutable value that persists for the duration of the program.\n!stream.resource&lt;constant&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Operations using resources carry the size of all operand result resources:</p> <pre><code>// %update (40 bytes) is being inserted into %target (296 bytes).\n// Can be dynamic values such as those originating from dynamic dimensions.\n%13 = stream.async.update %update, %target[%c256 to %c296] :\n    !stream.resource&lt;transient&gt;{%c40} -&gt;\n    %target as !stream.resource&lt;transient&gt;{%c296}\n</code></pre> <p>Once all <code>stream.async.*</code> work is moved into executable regions (such as <code>stream.async.execute</code>) <code>!stream.timepoint</code> values are used to sequence the execution. These timepoints represent some point in time where all execution up to that timepoint has completed and any results that were produced by the execution are available for use. Attempting to use the resources before their corresponding timepoint has been reached will lead to undefined behavior.

For example, it should be possible to lower the VM dialect to SPIR-V and run the VM entirely within a persistent Vulkan kernel.</p> <p>With this scalable runtime approach we make some limiting assumptions to keep the required implementations simple. As we assume all real math is happening within dispatch regions the only math we provide is scalar operations used for offset and shape calculations. This also enables simple flow control such as fixed-range loops.</p> <p>Besides integer values the only other storage type is a variant reference modeling an abstract iree_vm_ref_t. This allows automated reference counting to be relied upon by other dialects built on top of the VM dialect and avoids the need for more verbose manual reference counting logic (that may be difficult or impossible to manage given the coroutine-like nature of the VM).
