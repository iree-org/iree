We know what loop schedule and kernel we want the compiler to generate \u2014 essentially the same as we wrote in Ruy, give or take additional optimizations such as fusions and constant folding that become possible now that we are doing this within a compiler. This allows us to focus on how we get the compiler to generate that schedule and kernel with purely algebraic transformations that compose and enable further compiler optimizations.</p> <p>At the basis of this work is the extensible op system of the Linalg dialect in the MLIR compiler toolkit. In this case, a general purpose, mixed precision mmt4d op is defined via a high level description directly in the compiler and is then available to both users of the compiler (as a <code>linalg.mmt4d</code> op) or for direct emission via Python based IR construction (i.e. for direct integration into high level frameworks without rebuilding the compiler). The ability to define such new special forms cheaply, and without any systemic framework level cost, is part of the extensibility and composition story that we expect will become increasingly important in development and deployment scenarios in the future, and in this case, it let us spring board off of high quality code generation which was already well integrated and composed well with other features of the compiler.</p>","tags":["CPU"]},{"location":"community/blog/2021-10-13-matrix-multiplication-with-mmt4d/#existing-matrix-multplication-code-generation","title":"Existing Matrix Multplication Code Generation","text":"<p>Let us start by discussing IREE\u2019s existing matmul code generation and highlight the issues that <code>mmt4d</code> aims to overcome.</p> <p>The existing approach operates in-place on the source matrices. When we discuss \"tiling\" in this paragraph, we refer exclusively to the traversal \u2014 how these source matrices are traversed by the matmul loop. There is no \"tiled layout\" here, which will be the key difference with <code>mmt4d</code> below.</p> <p>The destination matrix is tiled into workgroups (CPU threads) tiles, then each workgroup tile is tiled to fit some level of CPU cache, and finally each tile is further tiled to fit target architecture registers (e.g. 8x8).</p> <p>That multi-level tiling means that the code works like the following loop nest:</p> <pre><code>def tiled_matmul(A, B, C, tile_m, tile_n, tile_k, tile_m_v, tile_n_v, tile_k_v):\n m = A.shape[0]\n k = A.shape[1]\n n = B.shape[1]\n for m1 in range(0, m, tile_m):\n   for n1 in range(0, n, tile_n):\n     for k1 in range(0, k, tile_k):\n       # First level of tiling views...\n       lhs_tile = A[m1:m1+tile_m, k1:k1+tile_k]\n       rhs_tile = B[k1:k1+tile_k, n1:n1+tile_n]\n       dst_tile = C[m1:m1+tile_m, n1:n1+tile_n]\n       for mv in range(0, tile_m, tile_m_v):\n         for nv in range(0, tile_n, tile_n_v):\n           for kv in range(0, tile_k, tile_k_v):\n             # Register tiling views...\n             lhs_tile_v = lhs_tile[mv:mv+tile_m_v, kv:kv+tile_k_v]\n             rhs_tile_v = rhs_tile[kv:kv+tile_k_v, nv:nv+tile_n_v]\n             # kernel.\n             dst_tile[mv:mv+tile_m_v, nv:nv+tile_n_v] += np.matmul(lhs_tile_v, rhs_tile_v)\n return C\n</code></pre> <p>The two main problems with this approach are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Overhead to meet SIMD ISA layout requirements: In practice, the kernel     needs to use specific SIMD     instructions to perform the arithmetic. They expect small tiles of the     matrices to be loaded in registers, in a specific layout. If the matrix data     wasn't already stored in memory in such a tiled layout, then the kernel has     to perform such a data rearrangement on the fly, incurring substantial     overhead. For NxN matrix multiplication, the kernel performs     O(N<sup>3</sup>) work on O(N<sup>2</sup>) data, so doing that rearrangement     there means O(N<sup>3</sup>) overhead where O(N<sup>2</sup>) should have     sufficed, as this could have been done as a pre-processing step on     O(N<sup>2</sup>) data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inefficent memory traversal: For efficiency reasons, we always need     <code>tile_m_v&gt;1</code> and <code>tile_n_v&gt;1</code>. That is because the higher these values, the     fewer memory-load instructions are needed overall; and this is also dictated     by the SIMD instructions that we want to use. But that means that the kernel     is accessing simultaneously multiple rows or columns of the left-hand and     right-hand side matrices. And in this existing approach, they are stored in     linear layout, not in a tiled layout, so these accesses are not contiguous     in memory. This is detrimental to memory access performance, meaning the     CPU caches, in multiple ways. One     is that these multiple non-contiguous accesses may alias each other in the     L1 cache because of low     associativity.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["CPU"]},{"location":"community/blog/2021-10-13-matrix-multiplication-with-mmt4d/#matrix-multiplication-operation-with-4d-tiled-operands","title":"Matrix Multiplication Operation With 4D Tiled Operands","text":"<p>For the reasons above, an efficient matmul implementation must reorder data into a tiled layout matching the target SIMD ISA and making the memory access patterns as contiguous as possible.</p> <p>IREE/MLIR defaults to bufferizing all tensors into a \"row-major\" order, meaning that the last-enumerated dimension is the one that is contiguous in memory. As we prefer not to write custom bufferization code, we can't specify an alternative layout for a tensor. Fortunately, it is possible to represent a 2D tiled layout as a 4D layout. For example, <code>tensor&lt;2x2x2x2xf32&gt;</code> can represent a 4x4 matrix made of 2x2 tiles, each of which is 2x2. The row-major layout on <code>tensor&lt;2x2x2x2xf32&gt;</code> makes each 2x2 tile contiguous and row-major, and arranges the 2x2 tiles themselves into a row-major 2x2 layout in the overall 4x4 matrix.</p> <p>Such a row-major-tiled layout is exactly what we need for the left-hand side of a matrix multiplication, because matrix multiplication traverses the left-hand side matrix row by row. But for the right-hand side matrix, we want a column-major-tiled layout. To solve this problem, we decide to implement not matrix multiplication, but matrix-multiplication-by-transposed-right-hand-side which is where the <code>t</code> in the <code>linalg.mmt4d</code> came from. Now such an op is happy with both the left and right-hand sides being row-major-tiled.</p> <p>The following example illustrates that. In these diagrams, each matrix element is rendered its memory offset.</p> <p></p> <p>To compute the 2x2 block in the destination matrix, we will have to load two yellow blocks from LHS, RHS matrices respectively compute their matmul results (i.e. call the kernel), then the two blue blocks, and so on. As we can see, each tile loads data that is not contiguous. It would be better if we rearranged the elements in the following layout:</p> <p></p> <p>Now tiles are stored contiguously in memory and the kernel can simply load them from memory into the registers that will be directly consumed by the SIMD instructions performing the multiplications. Moreover, the kernel is now loading from just two contiguous data streams, a simple memory access pattern which is sure to be efficient (regarding caches, etc) on any reasonable target hardware.</p> <p>We introduce a <code>linalg.mmt4d</code> operation that performs such a matrix multiplication on matrices in a tiled layout represented as 4D tensors. That leaves the question of how to represent, within the linalg dialect, the conversions between ordinary matrices represented as 2D tensors, and these tiled matrices represented as 4D tensors. Moreover, these conversions should be tileable and decompose well. Thankfully, the transformation from 2D to 4D can be written as a reshape followed by a transpose as in the following digram:</p> <p></p> <p>So we can think of the outermost two dimensions of the 4D representations as the tile position in the overall matrix, and the innermost two as the element position within one tile. Hopefully the following Python pseudocode makes it more concrete:</p> <pre><code>def pack_2d_4d(operand, parallel_size, reduction_size):\n i1 = operand.shape[0] // parallel_size # M1\n i2 = parallel_size    # M0\n j1 = operand.shape[1] // reduction_size # K1\n j2 = reduction_size   # K0\n operand_4d = np.reshape(operand, [i1, i2, j1, j2])\n return np.transpose(operand_4d, [0, 2, 1, 3]) # [M1, K1, M0, K0]\n</code></pre> <p>Now the mmt4d operation will follow a structure as the multi level tiling, for simplicity we considered the case here where no L1 tiling is required only first level of distribution to workgroups:</p> <pre><code>def mmt4d(A, B, C, M0, N0, K0):\n M = A.shape[0]\n N = B.shape[1]\n Bt = np.transpose(B, [1, 0])\n A4d = pack_2d_4d(A, M0, K0)\n Bt4d = pack_2d_4d(Bt, N0, K0)\n M1 = A4d.shape[0]\n N1 = Bt4d.shape[0]\n K1 = A4d.shape[1]\n for m1 in range(0, M1):\n   for n1 in range(0, N1):\n     for k1 in range(0, K1):\n       # Tile views that are contiguous in memory.\n       lhs_tile = np.reshape(A4d[m1, k1, :, :], [M0, K0])\n       rhs_tile = np.reshape(Bt4d[n1, k1, :, :], [N0, K0])\n       # Inner kernel.\n       C[m1, n1, :, :] += np.matmul(lhs_tile, np.transpose(rhs_tile, [1, 0]))\n # 4d -&gt; 2D\n C2d = unpack_4d_2d(C)\n return C2d\n</code></pre> <p>The resulting 4D tiled matrix still needs be rearranged back to the original layout as 2D tensor:</p> <pre><code>def unpack_4d_2d(operand):\n i1 = operand.shape[0] # M1\n j1 = operand.shape[1] # N1\n i2 = operand.shape[2] # M0\n j2 = operand.shape[3] # N0\n operand_transposed = operand.transpose([0, 2, 1, 3]) # [M1, M0, N1, N0]\n return operand_transposed.reshape([i1 * i2, j1 * j2]) # [M, N]\n</code></pre>","tags":["CPU"]},{"location":"community/blog/2021-10-13-matrix-multiplication-with-mmt4d/#performance-results","title":"Performance Results","text":"<p>We benchmarked various float32 matmul problems of different sizes and the result showed that mmt4d is faster than the existing matmul implementation for bigger matrices as we can see the in the following chart:</p> <p></p> <p>The SIMD instruction being used here is the simplest kind, a <code>vector*scalar</code> multiplication, and the storage orders of the matrices allow the existing implementation to directly load the vectors from the source matrices without any rearrangement overhead.

In this way we can allow multiple invocations of exported functions to chain naturally with internal asynchronous workloads, turning most IREE invocations into just recording of command buffers that can never block.</p> <p>When combined with VM coroutine support we even have the ability to interleave any required host execution between the wait and signal semaphores provided such that the caller never knows on which device execution is taking place.

This works when each individual operation is relatively costly vs. potential pipeline bubbles caused by work spinning down near the end of an operation and spinning up at the beginning of the next.</p> <p>IREE is designed to handle many more workloads - some of which have very narrow shapes but very deep pipelines (like search algorithms) - such that the above approach of multithreading within ops becomes a bottleneck. These workloads are traditionally very poorly handled by frameworks and issues with oversubscription, pipeline stalls, and suboptimal system schedulers (such as on Android) can lead to more time being spent thrashing about than actually executing real work.</p> <p>The approach we take here is to treat the cores of a CPU as if they were computation units on a GPU, each able to perform some set of heterogeneous work independent of others units. This means that the concurrency we are trying to model at the <code>flow</code> level and communicate to the runtime via the <code>hal</code> that explicitly states which dispatches can overlap and the size of the workgroups can trivially be used to distribute this work over many cores exactly as a GPU would do it. Integration with library calls that may require their own threading (such as Ruy) requires that they be able to use the IREE thread pool instead of their own.</p> <p>In this way we can avoid pipeline bubbles and other latency-inducing unpredictable scheduling. This does not mean that we treat individual units of work at the same scale as we would for GPUs, but instead that we tile and have one or more processing units that allows us to work on those tiles. Whether the tile size is defined by a library call contract, heuristics, or empirically is TBD, but expect workgroup sizes in the thousands to millions of invocations vs. normal GPU workgroup sizes in the dozens to hundreds of invocations.</p> <p>To achieve this style of scheduling efficiently we'll likely use something like marl as the scheduler. Marl provides cross-platform low-overhead fibers and is compatible with this style of scheduling as it was built for the Swiftshader software rasterizer.</p> <p>Even if IREE was only targeting CPUs the assertion is that we would still want to schedule this way and it's only an incidental benefit that if building for heterogeneous targets the scheduling code may be shared (just with a different divisor for workgroup count calculations).</p>"},{"location":"developers/design-docs/design-roadmap/#vm-lightweight-virtual-machine","title":"<code>vm</code>: Lightweight Virtual Machine","text":"<p>The VM is designed as a dynamic linkage ABI, stable bytecode representation, and intermediate lowering IR.

Coroutines are what will allow us to have multiple in-flight invocations into a module - some of which may be waiting on external events - without the need for complex multithreading logic or state machine machinations.</p> <p>In many cases once semaphores are exposed to callers we will not need to yield in the VM. The user will call into the module with provided semaphores, the work to perform will be recorded to one or more command buffers and submitted to the device, and then control return will return to the caller immediately.</p> <p>In cases requiring host readbacks that we were not able to remove, however, additional VM code may need to run prior to when the final semaphore is signaled. To preserve the asynchronous interface and immediate execution guarantees the compiler can emit explicit yield points (<code>vm.yield</code>) that are known-good locations for yielding (such as most resources not required after the yield having been flushed/discarded, partial synchronization scope availability if other work may be able to execute concurrently irrespective of the yielded coroutine, etc).</p> <p>When the VM encounters the yield at runtime it will suspend the coroutine until a defined condition is met. Many coroutines can be in various states at any given time and - thanks to the resource timeline - can still be memory safe. For example if two stateless invocations are made with a common wait semaphore both can be recorded and submitted without waiting on each other. If there is internal module state accessed the invocations are implicitly ordered by invocation order (similar to what Vulkan calls API order) based on internal resource timeline semaphores.</p> <p>Waking the coroutines can be performed by either an application-provided callback in the case of the application already having a periodic event which is doing bookkeeping (such as frame end callbacks when rendering or Looper idle events on Android), giving direct control over the frequency and location which IREE utilizes to perform additional work. A helper will be provided as well that runs a dedicated IREE thread to do this, but the expectation is that applications can often do a better (and importantly more predictable) job.</p> <p>By utilizing coroutines IREE will have a way to fill traditional pipeline bubbles even with execution from the same module (let alone across modules) in the situation where host readbacks or other logic is required. This increases overall throughput and utilization while reducing host wakeups as many coroutines can be processed at once to submit new work to the device queues, though it does not help reduce per-invocation latency.</p> <p>External code such as the HAL implementation or user ops may provide the wait handles used for continuation. For example, the HAL can expose a function that yields and wakes only when one or more timeline semaphores reach their target values:</p> <pre><code>// submit work\nhal.device.yield %semaphore4 &gt;= %sem4_target, %semaphore5 &gt;= %sem5_target\n// continue here, possibly much later in time\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"developers/design-docs/design-roadmap/#cellular-batching","title":"Cellular Batching","text":"<p>Though coroutines help throughput there is a way we've found to reduce latency that's been documented as cellular batching. This same technique has been implemented in prior internal systems and is one of the motivating design goals for IREE's creation. The core idea is to identify small uniform work that can be partitioned and scheduled greedily such as to enable batching or reduce associated invocation costs (such as refreshing accelerator SRAM/caches with new parameters). This usually manifests as finding large GEMM/GEMV operations using the same fixed parameters and either dynamically increasing the batch size by adding the waiting work (without deferring the actual execution time) or sequencing them back to back to ensure better cache utilization. Which approach is taken depends on any data dependencies that may be present (such as LSTM state feedback edges).</p> <p>With the foundation of coroutines in IREE it's possible to yield execution at any given point - including during command buffer recording - and wake on specific conditions. A majority of the logic can be built into the module itself with very little need for runtime machinery, as shared VM variables can be used to track pending work across invocations (even from different parts of the program) and flush based on logic wholly controlled by the user or compiler (such as count/max time latency/etc limits). This allows for the large variety of scheduling behavior various applications may want to use, such as a zero-latency batch-only-within-this-invocation to a Nagle's Algorithm-esque time or limit based behavior or even some learned model-specific windowing.</p> <p>Design work is still required on how to represent this in IR but the current thought is to model the regions in which deferred execution is possible and beneficial and allow during lowering to the VM additional transformations. This is similar to how the async-await behavior works in C# where the async keyword is just sugar that expands to additional generated helper utilities.</p> <p>A simple strawman representation for sequential dispatch may look like:</p> <pre><code>hal.scheduling_policy @defer_policy {\n  // max time, max count, max live memory, etc\n}\n...\nhal.command_buffer.dispatch.deferred @defer_policy, @dispatch, ...\n// vm.yield added here during lowering\n</code></pre> <p>There are many cases to explore and as cellular batching can have performance benefits of several orders of magnitudes it'll be one of the primary areas of research in the long-term.</p>"},{"location":"developers/design-docs/design-roadmap/#lowering-to-llvm-ir","title":"Lowering to LLVM IR","text":"<p>For scenarios where dynamic module loading is not required and entire modules can be compiled into applications we can lower the VM IR to LLVM IR within MLIR's transformation pipeline.

Or they could decide to only deal with synchronous invocations and return a program-allocated buffer view with the appropriate shape in their callback.

Storage buffers, however, can easily take hundreds of MB per invocation for I/O and transient state. This compounds as program usage becomes more complex or multiple programs are involved. IREE supports traditional host-ordered allocations (\u00e0 la malloc/free) for persistent buffers like large constants/read-only data or user-managed ringbuffers. Stream-ordered allocations are also supported to allow for pooled buffer reservations that can be allocated in a scheduled order alongside program execution.</p> <p>For more detailed examples see the CUDA blog posts describing their implementation: part 1, part 2.</p> <p>With stream-ordered allocations each allocation and deallocation operation is scheduled with wait and signal fences just as with invocations. This allows these allocation operations to execute remotely on device without host program involvement. For example, scheduling <code>alloca0</code>/<code>dealloca0</code> and <code>alloca1</code>/<code>dealloca1</code> interleaved with the function execution allows for the transient memory required for executing <code>@fn0</code> to remain uncommitted until immediately before it is executed, committed during execution, and then decommitted immediately after execution. The memory required for passing data from <code>@fn0</code> to the subsequent <code>@fn1</code> and <code>@fn2</code> survives until after they have completed executing before being decommitted. By using the same scheduling primitives as execution the allocation topology can be as arbitrarily complex as the invocation topology:</p> <pre><code>stateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    state fence0a &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    [*] --&gt; fence0a\n    state fence0b &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    fence0a --&gt; alloca0\n    fence0a --&gt; alloca1\n    alloca0 --&gt; fence0b\n    alloca1 --&gt; fence0b\n    fence0b --&gt; @fn0\n    state fence1a &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    @fn0 --&gt; fence1a\n    state fence1b &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    fence1a --&gt; dealloc0\n    dealloc0 --&gt; fence1b\n    fence1b --&gt; @fn1\n    fence1b --&gt; @fn2\n    state fence2a &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;\n    @fn1 --&gt; fence2a\n    @fn2 --&gt; fence2a\n    state fence2b\n    fence2a --&gt; dealloc1\n    state fence2b &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;\n    dealloc1 --&gt; fence2b\n    fence2b --&gt; [*]</code></pre> <p>When operating in this way allocations from the host-perspective are just reservations for a slice of pooled storage that will be committed at some point in the future. Likewise deallocations from the host-perspective release the prior reservation and schedule the paired decommit at some point in the future. Scheduling N sequential invocations thus requires only enough committed storage for a single invocation in addition to the I/O (unless that too is stream-ordered).</p> <p>This scheduling behavior allows for both minimal peak memory consumption regardless of the number of programs or invocation pipeline depth and sharing of committed storage across programs: the memory consumption of a program at rest is near zero when stateless and the sum of all state when stateful. Target devices that natively support stream-ordered allocations (like CUDA) can even share pools across processes.</p> <p>The other provided feature in combination with the fence guaranteed forward progress is that so long as the memory pool can service a single request execution can still continue even when constrained. A device can serialize two independent invocations requiring 400MB of transient memory when the system only has 512MB available with no user-visible impact besides increased latency. This does require the user to ensure they schedule work that is possible to run or rely on the target system having paging in order to lighten the strictness of the pool quotas.</p> <p>Stream-ordered allocations performed by the user for invocation inputs can be declared as transferred to the program. This allows the program to eagerly deallocate or reuse the input storage while still preserving the internal scheduling requirements of the program.</p>"},{"location":"developers/design-docs/invocation-execution-model/#internal-state","title":"Internal State","text":"<p>A stateful program may contain internal timelines that it uses to order its own execution.

MLIR value-semantic tensors are used as the primary data type to allow SSA use-def to provide a bulk of the infrastructure required to perform the computation partitioning and outlining.</p> <p>The dialect is designed to ingest relatively high-level linear algebra via XLA HLO ops (that also operate on the value-semantic tensor types) and optionally MLIR standard ops for control flow and other actions. After conversion of any higher-level ops that have special semantics in the flow dialect, such as global variables, the rest are partitioned into regions containing simple and compatible computations. Finally, outlining moves the computations into executables and leaves only the execution flow encoded via dispatch operations.</p> <p>The primary unit of interest is a \"dispatch region\" containing compatible computations that can be scheduled together efficiently (and safely). \"Compatible\" here is specified as similarly shaped workloads that indicate how many invocations a computation can be parallelized across when running in a SPMD execution model. Though it depends on the particular runtime backends this more concretely means things like the untiled workload (or tiled workgroups) used in GPU dispatches or similar thread pool executors.</p> <p>After identification of the dispatchable regions a set of transformations performs folding and simplification to reduce the total number of dispatches. Heuristics are used in certain cases to more efficiently schedule special ops (such as GEMM) and the design is amenable to profile- guided analysis that can be added in the future.</p> <p>The resulting outlined executable modules containing the dispatchable code can be translated to one or more backends (such as SPIR-V for Vulkan, or LLVM IR for running on the CPU, etc). The IR that is outlined is untouched and in the input format (such as XLA HLO ops) allowing conversion using any MLIR target that supports ingesting such input. A few special ops are used to communicate statically available information such as the expected workload size, shapes of inputs and outputs, etc.</p> <ul> <li>'flow' Dialect<ul> <li>Operation

Objects are declared per executable target and selected automatically during linking based on where the dispatch is used. Semantically this is equivalent to a <code>flow.dispatch.workgroups</code> but with the workgroup region invisible to the compiler. See <code>hal.executable</code> for more information about object linkage.</p> <p>Note that since this happens at tensor level the dispatch operation has value semantics: some tensors (and optionally other primitive types) are consumed and one or more new result tensors are produced. Inside each workgroup, however, the input and output tensors are available for arbitrary loads and stores. In many cases each workgroup will load some particular tile(s) from the input tensors and store some particular tile(s) to the output tensors unique to that workgroup. Though it's possible for multiple workgroups to load the same regions of the input tensors behavior is undefined if multiple workgroups store to the same regions of the output tensors. Codegen guarantees this behavior but when sourcing externally authored dispatch functions it's critical that this behavior is observed.</p> <p>Though the representation is similar to the GPU-style grid dispatch model here we still have not yet allocated buffers, determined the target device for execution, or even completed fully resolving shapes/types/etc. Because of this it's important that the workgroup body use the platform-dependent primitives for accessing workgroup ID, size, and count intrinsics instead of hardcoding them to a particular set of values. Assume that any workgroup dispatch may end up being specialized for several different target devices and even several different variants for a particular target device (differing workgroup sizes, etc). To aid deduplication code producing these external dispatches should try not to specialize early for particular shapes and instead emit the most generic code possible as having 500 slightly different <code>hal.dispatch.extern</code> ops pointing at the same object file is likely to require 500 copies of the object instead of 500 calls to the same object.</p> <p>Because at this point in the layering devices have not yet been selected the workgroup count cannot be fully evaluated. Instead workload parameters are captured that are then passed to a function that when later evaluated computes the actual workgroup count based on target information. The workload is not limited to the 3D XYZ grid dispatch of the workgroup count and can contain any number of parameters used to compute it. If workgroup size or distribution varies based on the target device a <code>!hal.device</code> argument can be used by the workgroup count calculation region to factor in device parameters.

At entry <code>stream.tensor.*</code> ops are used to capture the source tensor encoding information (data type, shapes, etc) and then lowered into <code>stream.async.*</code> ops that model the asynchronous workloads on the opaque resources. The asynchronous operations are then partitioned, allocated, and scheduled for execution using the <code>stream.cmd.*</code> ops.</p> <p>It's intended that after transformation through the stream dialect the program is ready for execution on an abstract machine. At this level of representation buffers have still not been allocated and devices are not yet resolved, however the information captured in the <code>stream</code> IR allows such operations to be done trivially. To this end all ops carry the symbolic size of the resources on which they operate as well as the lifetime of the resources they are acting upon. This manifests in the usage of the <code>!stream.resource</code> type:</p> <pre><code>// Unresolved lifetime (resolved during the iree-stream-refine-usage pass):\n!stream.resource&lt;*&gt;\n// An externally managed value (passed in via the program API).\n!stream.resource&lt;external&gt;\n// A staging buffer for uploads/downloads.\n!stream.resource&lt;staging&gt;\n// A short-lived value that is used across streams.\n!stream.resource&lt;transient&gt;\n// A long-lived value that persists across streams in globals.\n!stream.resource&lt;variable&gt;\n// An immutable value that persists for the duration of the program.\n!stream.resource&lt;constant&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Operations using resources carry the size of all operand result resources:</p> <pre><code>// %update (40 bytes) is being inserted into %target (296 bytes).\n// Can be dynamic values such as those originating from dynamic dimensions.\n%13 = stream.async.update %update, %target[%c256 to %c296] :\n    !stream.resource&lt;transient&gt;{%c40} -&gt;\n    %target as !stream.resource&lt;transient&gt;{%c296}\n</code></pre> <p>Once all <code>stream.async.*</code> work is moved into executable regions (such as <code>stream.async.execute</code>) <code>!stream.timepoint</code> values are used to sequence the execution. These timepoints represent some point in time where all execution up to that timepoint has completed and any results that were produced by the execution are available for use. Attempting to use the resources before their corresponding timepoint has been reached will lead to undefined behavior. The benefit of this is that after timepoints are established in the IR it's possible to induce aliasing of resources without breaking execution correctness.</p> <ul> <li>'stream' Dialect<ul>

For example, it should be possible to lower the VM dialect to SPIR-V and run the VM entirely within a persistent Vulkan kernel.</p> <p>With this scalable runtime approach we make some limiting assumptions to keep the required implementations simple. As we assume all real math is happening within dispatch regions the only math we provide is scalar operations used for offset and shape calculations. This also enables simple flow control such as fixed-range loops.</p> <p>Besides integer values the only other storage type is a variant reference modeling an abstract iree_vm_ref_t. This allows automated reference counting to be relied upon by other dialects built on top of the VM dialect and avoids the need for more verbose manual reference counting logic (that may be difficult or impossible to manage given the coroutine-like nature of the VM).
