# MLIR passes and pipelines

These pages contain automatically generated documentation for the MLIR pass
pipelines defined in the IREE repository. IREE also makes extensive use of
passes from the upstream MLIR repository, which are documented at
[https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Passes/](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Passes/).
