# CPU deployment

IREE supports efficient program execution on CPU devices by using
[LLVM](https://llvm.org/) to compile all dense computations in each program into
highly optimized CPU native instruction streams, which are embedded in one of
IREE's deployable formats.

To compile a program for CPU execution:

1. Pick a CPU target supported by LLVM. By default, IREE includes these LLVM
   targets:

    * X86
    * ARM
    * AArch64
    * RISCV

    Other targets may work, but in-tree test coverage and performance work is
    focused on that list.

2. Pick one of IREE's supported executable formats:

    | Executable Format | Description                                           |
    | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Embedded ELF      | (Default) Portable, high performance dynamic library  |
    | System library    | Platform-specific dynamic library (.so, .dll, etc.)   |
    | VMVX              | Reference target                                      |

At runtime, CPU executables can be loaded using one of IREE's CPU HAL devices:

* `local-task`: asynchronous, multithreaded device built on IREE's "task"
   system
* `local-sync`: synchronous, single-threaded devices that executes work inline

## :octicons-download-16: Prerequisites

### Get the IREE compiler

#### :octicons-download-16: Download the compiler from a release

Python packages are distributed through multiple channels. See the
[Python Bindings](../../reference/bindings/python.md) page for more details.
The core [`iree-base-compiler`](https://pypi.org/project/iree-base-compiler/)
package includes the compiler tools:

--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-compiler-from-release.md"

#### :material-hammer-wrench: Build the compiler from source

Please make sure you have followed the
[Getting started](../../building-from-source/getting-started.md) page to build
IREE for your host platform. The `llvm-cpu` compiler backend is compiled in by
default on all platforms, though you should ensure that the
`IREE_TARGET_BACKEND_LLVM_CPU` CMake option is `ON` when configuring.

!!! tip
    `iree-compile` will be built under the `iree-build/tools/` directory. You
    may want to include this path in your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Get the IREE runtime

You will need to get an IREE runtime that supports the local CPU HAL driver,
along with the appropriate executable loaders for your application.

You can check for CPU support by looking for the `local-sync` and `local-task`
drivers and devices:

```console hl_lines="10-11"
--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-run-module-driver-list.md:1"
```

```console hl_lines="4-5"
--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-run-module-device-list-amd.md"
```

#### :octicons-download-16: Download the runtime from a release

Python packages are distributed through multiple channels. See the
[Python Bindings](../../reference/bindings/python.md) page for more details.
The core [`iree-base-runtime`](https://pypi.org/project/iree-base-runtime/)
package includes the local CPU HAL drivers:

--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-runtime-from-release.md"

#### :material-hammer-wrench: Build the runtime from source

Please make sure you have followed one of the
[Building from source](../../building-from-source/index.md) pages to build
IREE for your target platform. The local CPU HAL drivers and devices are
compiled in by default on all platforms, though you should ensure that the
`IREE_HAL_DRIVER_LOCAL_TASK` and `IREE_HAL_EXECUTABLE_LOADER_EMBEDDED_ELF`
(or other executable loader) CMake options are `ON` when configuring.

## Compile and run a program

With the requirements out of the way, we can now compile a model and run it.

### :octicons-file-code-16: Compile a program

--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-import-onnx-mobilenet.md"

Then run the following command to compile with the `llvm-cpu` target:

``` shell hl_lines="2-3"
iree-compile \
    --iree-hal-target-backends=llvm-cpu \
    --iree-llvmcpu-target-cpu=host \
    mobilenetv2.mlir -o mobilenet_cpu.vmfb
```

???+ tip "Tip - Target CPUs and CPU features"

    By default, the compiler will use a generic CPU target which will result in
    poor performance. A target CPU or target CPU feature set should be selected
    using one of these options:

    * `--iree-llvmcpu-target-cpu=...`
    * `--iree-llvmcpu-target-cpu-features=...`

    When not cross compiling, passing `--iree-llvmcpu-target-cpu=host` is
    usually sufficient on most devices.

???+ tip "Tip - CPU targets"

    The `--iree-llvmcpu-target-triple` flag tells the compiler to generate code
    for a specific type of CPU. You can see the list of supported targets with
    `iree-compile --iree-llvmcpu-list-targets`, or use the default value of
    "host" to let LLVM infer the triple from your host machine
    (e.g. `x86_64-linux-gnu`).

    ```console
    $ iree-compile --iree-llvmcpu-list-targets

      Registered Targets:
        aarch64    - AArch64 (little endian)
        aarch64_32 - AArch64 (little endian ILP32)
        aarch64_be - AArch64 (big endian)
        arm        - ARM
        arm64      - ARM64 (little endian)
        arm64_32   - ARM64 (little endian ILP32)
        armeb      - ARM (big endian)
        riscv32    - 32-bit RISC-V
        riscv64    - 64-bit RISC-V
        wasm32     - WebAssembly 32-bit
        wasm64     - WebAssembly 64-bit
        x86        - 32-bit X86: Pentium-Pro and above
        x86-64     - 64-bit X86: EM64T and AMD64
    ```

### :octicons-terminal-16: Run a compiled program

To run the compiled program:

``` shell hl_lines="2"
iree-run-module \
    --device=local-task \
    --module=mobilenet_cpu.vmfb \
    --function=torch-jit-export \
    --input="1x3x224x224xf32=0"
```

The above assumes the exported function in the model is named `torch-jit-export`
and it expects one 224x224 RGB image. We are feeding in an image with all 0
values here for brevity, see `iree-run-module --help` for the format to specify
concrete values.
