# GPU deployment using CUDA

IREE can accelerate model execution on Nvidia GPUs using
[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

## :octicons-download-16: Prerequisites

In order to use CUDA to drive the GPU, you need to have a functional CUDA
environment. It can be verified by the following steps:

``` shell
nvidia-smi | grep CUDA
```

If `nvidia-smi` does not exist, you will need to
[install the latest CUDA Toolkit SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### Get the IREE compiler

#### :octicons-download-16: Download the compiler from a release

Python packages are distributed through multiple channels. See the
[Python Bindings](../../reference/bindings/python.md) page for more details.
The core [`iree-base-compiler`](https://pypi.org/project/iree-base-compiler/)
package includes the CUDA compiler:

--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-compiler-from-release.md"

#### :material-hammer-wrench: Build the compiler from source

Please make sure you have followed the
[Getting started](../../building-from-source/getting-started.md) page to build
the IREE compiler, then enable the CUDA compiler target with the
`IREE_TARGET_BACKEND_CUDA` option.

!!! tip
    `iree-compile` will be built under the `iree-build/tools/` directory. You
    may want to include this path in your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Get the IREE runtime

Next you will need to get an IREE runtime that includes the CUDA HAL driver.

You can check for CUDA support by looking for a matching driver and device:

```console hl_lines="8"
--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-run-module-driver-list.md:1"
```

```console hl_lines="3"
--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-run-module-device-list-nvidia.md"
```

#### :octicons-download-16: Download the runtime from a release

Python packages are distributed through multiple channels. See the
[Python Bindings](../../reference/bindings/python.md) page for more details.
The core [`iree-base-runtime`](https://pypi.org/project/iree-base-runtime/)
package includes the CUDA HAL driver:

--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-runtime-from-release.md"

#### :material-hammer-wrench: Build the runtime from source

Please make sure you have followed the
[Getting started](../../building-from-source/getting-started.md) page to build
IREE from source, then enable the CUDA HAL driver with the
`IREE_HAL_DRIVER_CUDA` option.

## Compile and run a program model

With the requirements out of the way, we can now compile a model and run it.

### :octicons-file-code-16: Compile a program

--8<-- "docs/website/docs/guides/deployment-configurations/snippets/_iree-import-onnx-mobilenet.md"

Then run the following command to compile with the `cuda` target:

```shell hl_lines="2-3"
iree-compile \
    --iree-hal-target-backends=cuda \
    --iree-cuda-target=<...> \
    mobilenetv2.mlir -o mobilenet_cuda.vmfb
```

???+ tip "Tip - CUDA targets"

    Canonically a CUDA target (`iree-cuda-target`) matching the LLVM NVPTX
    backend of the form `sm_<arch_number>` is needed to compile towards each GPU
    architecture. If no architecture is specified then we will default to
    `sm_60`.

    Here is a table of commonly used architectures:

    | CUDA GPU            | Target Architecture | Architecture Code Name
    | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------
    | NVIDIA P100         | `sm_60`             | `pascal`
    | NVIDIA V100         | `sm_70`             | `volta`
    | NVIDIA A100         | `sm_80`             | `ampere`
    | NVIDIA H100         | `sm_90`             | `hopper`
    | NVIDIA RTX20 series | `sm_75`             | `turing`
    | NVIDIA RTX30 series | `sm_86`             | `ampere`
    | NVIDIA RTX40 series | `sm_89`             | `ada`

    In addition to the canonical `sm_<arch_number>` scheme, `iree-cuda-target`
    also supports two additonal schemes to make a better developer experience:

    * Architecture code names like `volta` or `ampere`
    * GPU product names like `a100` or `rtx3090`

    These two schemes are translated into the canonical form under the hood.
    We add support for common code/product names without aiming to be exhaustive.
    If the ones you want are missing, please use the canonical form.

### :octicons-terminal-16: Run a compiled program

To run the compiled program:

``` shell hl_lines="2"
iree-run-module \
    --device=cuda \
    --module=mobilenet_cuda.vmfb \
    --function=torch-jit-export \
    --input="1x3x224x224xf32=0"
```

The above assumes the exported function in the model is named `torch-jit-export`
and it expects one 224x224 RGB image. We are feeding in an image with all 0
values here for brevity, see `iree-run-module --help` for the format to specify
concrete values.
