!!! tip
    `iree-compile` and other tools are installed to your python module
    installation path. If you pip install with the user mode, it is under
    `${HOME}/.local/bin`, or `%APPDATA%\Python` on Windows. You may want to
    include the path in your system's `PATH` environment variable:

    ```shell
    export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}
    ```
