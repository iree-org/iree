# Compile time regression debugging

So the IREE compiler used to compile a program quickly, but it is now slower.
What do you do?

## Initial information gathering

Try to answer as many of these questions as you can:

> **When did compilation get slower?**

  A specific git commit is ideal, but "sometime in the last week" is a good
  starting point. You'll ultimately want to find a culprit release or git
  commit that changed the compiler code.

> **How much slower did compilation get?**

  Be specific - did it jump from 1 minute to 2 minutes, or 1 minute to 1 hour?
  Identifying the scale of the regression can help set the priority to
  investigate it.

> **What is the full compile command?**

  Try to extract the input program and full list of flags passed to the
  compiler binary so that others can reproduce what you're seeing. Try to
  distill this as much as possible to using just native tools (no Python or
  other framework layers).

> **What environment is the compiler running in?**

  Are you using a `Debug` build, or a release build? What operating system and
  size machine is running the compiler (e.g. Linux developer machine, or a
  smaller system)?

## Culprit finding and bisecting

If you only have a rough idea of when something changed and want to narrow that
down to a specific code change, bisecting can help.

### Running `git bisect`

Building the compiler from source and using
[`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) will let you pinpoint
specific commits in IREE, though it typically won't let you step through changes
in submodules (e.g. MLIR updates in `third_party/llvm-project/`).

#### Scripted bisecting with package artifacts

See <https://github.com/iree-org/iree/tree/main/build_tools/pkgci/bisect>.

#### Manually bisecting with source builds

**Tip**: [Configure ccache](../building/cmake-with-ccache.md) if you'll be
rebuilding the compiler while bisecting

A manual workflow with `git bisect` looks like this:

```bash
git bisect start --first-parent
git bisect good [<rev>]
git bisect bad [<rev>]

# Read the prompts from the command as it runs
# At each step, test the compiler:
#   git submodule update
#   cmake --build build/ --target iree-compile
#   ./build/tools/iree-compile <args>
#       attach Tracy, observe timing, print IR, etc. to determine if fast or slow
#       if fast, `git bisect good`
#       if slow, `git bisect bad`
#   repeat
```

An automated workflow can use `git bisect run` and a script:

```shell title="run_bisect.sh"
git submodule update
cmake --build build/ --target iree-compile
# Other logic here
```

```bash
git bisect start --first-parent
git bisect good [<rev>]
git bisect bad [<rev>]
git bisect run run_bisect.sh
```

#### Sample: compile executable sources individually with a timeout

```bash title="run_bisect.sh"
#!/bin/bash

set -xeuo pipefail

    ${COMPILER_FLAGS[@]} \

    -o /dev/null
done
```

## Profiling and tracing

If you want to understand _why_ the compiler is fast or slow, or if you want to
compare performance in detail between two versions, consider these profiling
options.

### MLIR pass timing

The `-mlir-timing` flag enables
[Pass Timing](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/PassManagement/#pass-timing)
instrumentation. Once the compiler finishes running, this prints a report like

```shell
===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===
                      ... Pass execution timing report ...
===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===
  Total Execution Time: 0.0203 seconds

   ---Wall Time---  --- Name ---
   0.0047 ( 55.9%)  Canonicalizer
   0.0019 ( 22.2%)  VerifierPass
   0.0016 ( 18.5%)  LLVMLoweringPass
   0.0003 (  3.4%)  CSE
   0.0002 (  1.9%)  (A) DominanceInfo
   0.0084 (100.0%)  Total
```

This is easy data to collect, especially remotely over SSH, but it might not
paint a complete picture and requires waiting for compilation to finish.

### Using Tracy

See our documentation on
[profiling with Tracy](../performance/profiling-with-tracy.md), in particular
the section on
[tracing `iree-compile`](../performance/profiling-with-tracy.md#tracing-iree-compile).
For compile time regressions, pay particular attention to the compilation
phases (Flow/Stream/HAL), how many times `TranslateAllExecutablesPass` runs, and
if there are outlier passes that take significantly longer to run than others.

Here are some previous analyses for inspiration:

### Using `perf` and `pprof`

These linux tools allow for fine-grained profiling. Below we present a list of
steps to profile `iree-compile` and visualize the results as a flame graph.

1. Compile IREE tools with debug information (line tables at minimum) and frame
   pointers. You can do that by selecting the `RelWithDebInfo` build type and
   adding `-fno-omit-frame-pointers` to your compiler flags:

     ```shell
     cmake <Your-CMAKE-Flags> \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
        -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fno-omit-frame-pointer"
     ```

2. Set perf event scope/access to the appropriate level with
   [`perf_event_paranoid`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.7/admin-guide/perf-security.html#perf-events-perf-unprivileged-users).

     ```shell
     echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
     ```

3. Run `iree-compile` under the `perf` profiler and collect profile data. This
   requires `sudo`.

     ```shell
     sudo perf record -F 999 -g -- tools/iree-compile <Your-Compile-Arguments>
     sudo chown "$USER:$USER" perf.data
     ```

4. Use `pprof` to process `perf.data` from the previous step and start a local
   http server with the visualized profile. See the
   [`pprof`'s README](https://github.com/google/pprof) for installation
   instructions and make sure to build
   [`perf_data_converter`](https://github.com/google/perf_data_converter) and
   add it to your `PATH`.

     ```shell
     pprof -http ':' perf.data
     ```

## Stepping through compiler IR

Debugging an MLIR-based compiler like IREE usually involves reading IR at some
point. For compile time regressions, it helps to snapshot the IR at a few key
phases and look for differences between fast compilation and slow compilation.

Here is one useful flag combination:

```shell
--mlir-disable-threading \
--mlir-elide-elementsattrs-if-larger=8 \
--mlir-print-ir-after=iree-hal-materialize-interfaces
```
