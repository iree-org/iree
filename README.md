# IREE: Intermediate Representation Execution Environment

<p><img src="docs/website/docs/assets/images/IREE_Logo_Icon_Color.svg" width="48px"></p>

IREE (**I**ntermediate **R**epresentation **E**xecution **E**nvironment,
pronounced as "eerie") is an [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/)-based end-to-end
compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR
that scales up to meet the needs of the datacenter and down to satisfy the
constraints and special considerations of mobile and edge deployments.

See [our website](https://iree.dev/) for project details, user
guides, and instructions on building from source.
