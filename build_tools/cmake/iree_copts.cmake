# Everything here is added to *every* iree_cc_library/iree_cc_binary/etc.
# That includes both runtime and compiler components, and these may propagate
# out to user code interacting with either (such as custom modules).
#
# Be extremely judicious in the use of these flags.
#
# - Need to disable a warning?
#   Usually these are encountered in compiler-specific code and can be disabled
#   in a compiler-specific way. Only add global warning disables when it's clear
#   that we never want them or that they'll show up in a lot of places.
#
#   See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3378560/how-to-disable-gcc-warnings-for-a-few-lines-of-code
#
# - Need to add a linker dependency?
#   First figure out if you *really* need it. If it's only required on specific
#   platforms and in very specific files clang or msvc are used prefer
#   autolinking. GCC is stubborn and doesn't have autolinking so additional
#   flags may be required there.
#
#   See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-linking
#
# - Need to tweak a compilation mode setting (debug/asserts/etc)?
#   Don't do that here, and in general *don't do that at all* unless it's behind
#   a very specific IREE-prefixed cmake flag (like IREE_SIZE_OPTIMIZED).
#   There's no one-size solution when we are dealing with cross-project and
#   cross-compiled binaries - there's no safe way to set global options that
#   won't cause someone to break, and you probably don't really need to do
#   change that setting anyway. Follow the rule of least surprise: if the user
#   has CMake's Debug configuration active then don't force things into release
#   mode, etc.
#
# - Need to add an include directory?
#   Don't do that here. Always prefer to fully-specify the path from the IREE
#   workspace root when it's known that the compilation will be occuring using
#   the files within the IREE checkout; for example, instead of adding a global
#   include path to third_party/foo/ and #include <foo.h>'ing, just
#   #include "third_party/foo/foo.h". This reduces build configuration, makes it
#   easier for readers to find the files, etc.
#
# - Still think you need to add an include directory? (system includes, etc)
#   Don't do that here, either. It's highly doubtful that every single target in
#   all of IREE (both compiler and runtime) on all platforms (both host and
#   cross-compilation targets) needs your special include directory. Add it on
#   the COPTS of the target you are using it in and, ideally, private to that
#   target (used in .c/cc files, not in a .h that leaks the include path
#   requirements to all consumers of the API).
