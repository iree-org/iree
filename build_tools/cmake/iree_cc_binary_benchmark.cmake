# iree_cc_binary_benchmarks()
#
# Creates a binary and a test for a cc benchmark target.
#
# It's good to test that benchmarks run, but it's really annoying to run a
# billion iterations of them every time you try to run tests. So we create these
# as binaries and then invoke them as tests with `--benchmark_min_time=0`.
#
# Mirrors the bzl function of the same name. See iree_cc_binary and iree_cc_test
# for more details on those rules
#
# Parameters:
# NAME: name for the binary target. The test target will be "${NAME}_test"
# SRCS: List of source files for the binary
# DATA: List of other targets and files required for the binary
# DEPS: List of other libraries to be linked in to the binary
# COPTS: List of private compile options for the binary
# DEFINES: List of public defines for the binary
# LINKOPTS: List of link options for the binary
# TESTONLY: whether the binary should only be compiled for tests
# HOSTONLY: whether the binary should be compiled using host toolchain when
#   cross-compiling
# LABELS: Additional labels to apply to the test. The package path is added
#     automatically.
