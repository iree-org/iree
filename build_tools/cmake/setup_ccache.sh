# ccache (https://ccache.dev/) setup, with read/write + local/remote options.
#
# Defaults to only reading from the shared remote cache (hosted on GCS) used by
# our Linux CI. The postsubmit CI writes to the cache, for presubmit CI and
# local builds to read from.
#
# Local caches can also be used to interface with external remote caches
# (like https://github.com/actions/cache) by
#   1. downloading the cache directory
#   2. sourcing with IREE_READ_LOCAL_CCACHE=1 IREE_WRITE_LOCAL_CCACHE=[0,1]
#   3. building with CMake
#   4. uploading the cache directory (if writing)
#
# Note: this file must be *sourced* not executed.
