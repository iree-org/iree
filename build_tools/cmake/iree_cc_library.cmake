# iree_cc_library()
#
# CMake function to imitate Bazel's cc_library rule.
#
# Parameters:
# PACKAGE: Name of the package (overrides actual path)
# NAME: name of target (see Note)
# HDRS: List of public header files for the library
# TEXTUAL_HDRS: List of public header files that cannot be compiled on their own
# SRCS: List of source files for the library
# DATA: List of other targets and files required for this binary
# DEPS: List of other libraries to be linked in to the binary targets
# DISABLE_LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB: Disables linking against the libLLVM.so dynamic
#   library, even if the build is configured to do so. This must be used with
#   care as it can only contain dependencies and be used by binaries that also
#   so disable it (either in upstream LLVM or locally). In practice, it is used
#   for LLVM dependency chains that must always result in static-linked tools.
# COPTS: List of private compile options
# DEFINES: List of public defines
# INCLUDES: Include directories to add to dependencies
# SYSTEM_INCLUDES: Include directories that should be used with "SYSTEM" scope,
#   which makes them more tolerant to certain classes of warnings and issues.
# LINKOPTS: List of link options
# PUBLIC: Add this so that this library will be exported under iree::
# Also in IDE, target will appear in IREE folder while non PUBLIC will be in IREE/internal.
# TESTONLY: When added, this target will only be built if user passes -DIREE_BUILD_TESTS=ON to CMake.
# SHARED: If set, will compile to a shared object.
# WINDOWS_DEF_FILE: If set, will add a windows .def file to a shared library link
# Note:
# By default, iree_cc_library will always create a library named iree_${NAME},
# and alias target iree::${NAME}. The iree:: form should always be used.
# This is to reduce namespace pollution.
