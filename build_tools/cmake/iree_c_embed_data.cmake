# iree_c_embed_data()
#
# CMake function matching the iree_c_embed_data rule.
#
# Parameters:
# PACKAGE: Name of the package (overrides actual path)
# NAME: Name of target (see Note).
# SRCS: List of files to embed (in source or build directory).
# INCLUDES: Include directories to add to dependencies
# C_FILE_OUTPUT: The C implementation file to output.
# H_FILE_OUTPUT: The H header file to output.
# STRIP_PREFIX: Strips this verbatim prefix from filenames (in the TOC).
# FLATTEN: Removes all directory components from filenames (in the TOC).
# IDENTIFIER: The identifier to use in generated names (defaults to name).
# PUBLIC: Add this so that this library will be exported under ${PACKAGE}::
# Also in IDE, target will appear in ${PACKAGE} folder while non PUBLIC will be
# in ${PACKAGE}/internal.
# TESTONLY: When added, this target will only be built if user passes
#    -DIREE_BUILD_TESTS=ON to CMake.
# TODO(scotttodd): Support passing KWARGS down into iree_cc_library?

      # the current binary dir. And if it was already relative to the current
      # binary dir, then the regex should fail to match (unless we're very
      # unlucky and we have paths of the from root/a/b/a/b, but that's not a
