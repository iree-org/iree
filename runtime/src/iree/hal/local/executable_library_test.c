// Demonstration of the HAL-side of the iree_hal_executable_library_t ABI.
// This is the lowest level of the system right before calling into generated
// code.
//
// This shows what the various execution systems are doing (through a lot
// of fancy means): all `inline_command_buffer.c` and `task_command_buffer.c`
// lead up to just calling into the iree_hal_executable_dispatch_v0_t entry
// point functions with a state structure and a workgroup XYZ.
//
// Below walks through acquiring the library pointer (which in this case is a
// hand-coded example to show the codegen-side), setting up the I/O buffers and
// state, and calling the function to do some math.
//
// See iree/hal/local/executable_library.h for more information.
