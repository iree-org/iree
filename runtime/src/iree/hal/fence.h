// when used for both signaling and waiting; users should try to build as few
// fences as possible. Semaphores are retained for the lifetime of the fence.

// is undefined if any queue operations using the fence are in-flight.

// Waiting on a NULL fence completes immediately and signaling a NULL fence is
