// Allocated memory buffer wrapper type and utilities.
//
// Buffers are the basic unit of memory used by the inference system. They may
// be allocated such that they are accessible from the host (normal C++ code
// running on the main CPU), a particular device (such as an accelerator) or
// family of devices, or from some mix of all of those.
//
// The type of memory a buffer is allocated within has implications on it's
// performance and lifetime. For example if an application attempts to use a
// host-allocated buffer (IREE_HAL_MEMORY_TYPE_HOST_LOCAL) on an accelerator
// with discrete memory the accelerator may either be unable to access the
// memory or take a non-trivial performance hit when attempting to do so
// (involving setting up kernel mappings, doing DMA transfers, etc). Likewise,
// trying to access a device-allocated buffer
// (IREE_HAL_MEMORY_TYPE_DEVICE_LOCAL) may incur similar overhead or not be
// possible at all. This may be due to restrictions in the memory visibility,
// address spaces, mixed endianness or pointer widths, and other weirdness.
//
// The memory types (defined by a bitfield of iree_hal_memory_type_t values)
// that a particular context (host or device) may use vary from device to device
// and must be queried by the application when allocating buffers. It's strongly
// recommended that the most specific memory type be set as possible. For
// example allocating a buffer with IREE_HAL_MEMORY_TYPE_HOST_COHERENT even when
// it will never be used in a way that requires coherency may occupy address
// space reservations or memory mapping that would otherwise not be needed.
//
// As buffers may sometimes not be accessible from the host the base buffer type
// does not allow for direct void* access and instead buffers must be either
// manipulated using utility functions (such as ReadData or WriteData) or by
// mapping them into a host-accessible address space via MapMemory. Buffers must
// be unmapped before any command may use them.
//
// Buffers may equate (roughly) 1:1 with an allocation either from the host heap
// or a device. iree_hal_buffer_subspan can be used to reference subspans of
// buffers like std::span - though unlike std::span the returned buffer holds
// a reference to the parent buffer.

// Tracking the preserve count independently allows the application to eagerly
// deallocate the buffer without relying on the lifetime of the object to do so.
