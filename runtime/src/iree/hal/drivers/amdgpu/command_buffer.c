// A host-side HAL command buffer wrapping a device-side handle.
// Each command buffer can be recorded for multiple physical devices where all
// data will reside in device-local memory. Expensive validation, encoding
// logic, and resource tracking are amortized across all devices the command
// buffer is recorded for.
//
// Once finalized a command buffer owns per-device references to a list of
// memory blocks holding command buffer metadata such as the device-side
// iree_hal_amdgpu_device_command_buffer_t and its CFG blocks and list of
// memory blocks holding any embedded data used by the command buffer such as
// bindings/constants and inline buffer uploads.
//
// During recording iree_hal_amdgpu_command_encoder_t is used to track the
// current block, total counts required for allocating final device resources,
// and per-device arenas. Once recording completes the encoder is discarded.
//
// A goal was to have the cost of recording a command buffer for a single device
// not suffer from the support for multiple devices - in most cases no
// additional memory during recording and at rest will be allocated beyond what
// would have been needed if this only supported a single device and besides a
// predictable 1-trip loop has no meaningful additional per-command overhead.
//
// Attention is paid to recording performance even though we expect most large
// command buffers to be recorded at initialization time and reused. Though IREE
// compiled programs can easily reuse command buffers applications directly
// using the HAL may not be able to and we want one-shot command buffers to not
// be super inefficient. A one-shot command buffer will never achieve the
// latency of a CUDA stream-like API but 99% of application-level operations are
// copies that either could benefit from batching or could be done unbatched at
// the queue level. The HAL as a whole focuses more on the expensive parts of
// the program than the cheap/garbage-y ones: it's best to have deterministic
// excellent performance on critical workloads than to have low latency in
// naively authored applications. We do upload block metadata and embedded
// storage data to devices as we record the command buffer such that after
// recording completes we can launch the command buffer immediately but we
// cannot time-travel to begin executing while the command buffer is still
// recording.
//
// One thing we could support is using SDMA to upload the command buffer
// contents asynchronously with the recording. There are some notes sprinkled
// around about supporting relocatable command buffers by storing only relative
// offsets in all data. If command buffers _were_ relocatable we could record on
// the host and broadcast to all devices with SDMA, or record to a single device
// and use P2P SDMA to replicate it.
//

// threads are allowed to submit the command buffer for execution concurrently.
