// Each platform handles this differently (if at all).
//
// macOS/iOS:
//   Only affinity tags are supported; the ID will be used by the kernel to
//   group threads that having matching values together and (hopefully) schedule
//   them on cores that may share some level of the cache hierarchy. The API is
//   effectively just asking nicely and hoping the kernel is on the same
//   wavelength. It rarely is. As a workaround for the lack of specific pinning
//   we use the smt bit of 1 to indicate that _only_ efficiency cores should be
//   used by effectively changing the QoS of the thread to one in the range
//   where only efficiency cores will be used.
//
//   Mapping:
//    group: (unused)
//       id: used for THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY to request exclusive cores.
//      smt: 1 if only efficiency cores should be used (QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND).
//
// Linux/Android:
//   sched_setaffinity is used to pin the thread to the core with the given ID.
//   There are, naturally, issues on Android where if the governor has turned
//   off some cores (such as powering down big cores in an ARM big.LITTLE
//   configuration) the affinity request will be dropped on the floor even if
//   the cores are later enabled. This is one of the reasons why we note in
//   iree_thread_request_affinity that requests may need to be made at
//   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ intervals. In the future we can try to hook into power
//   management infra to see if we can tell when we need to do this.
//
//   Mapping:
//    group: NUMA node passed to set_mempolicy.
//       id: CPU_SET bit indicating which CPU to run on.
//      smt: whether to CPU_SET both the base ID and the subsequent ID.
//
// Windows:
//   Stuff just works. Love it.
//
//   Mapping:
//    group: GROUP_AFFINITY::Group/PROCESSOR_NUMBER::Group.
//       id: GROUP_AFFINITY::Mask bit/PROCESSOR_NUMBER::Number.
//      smt: whether to set both the base ID and the subsequent ID in Mask.
