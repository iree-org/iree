    This can be thought of as a Vulkan-like model with all of the graphics bits
    chopped out.

    The type set is limited to those that can be represented in the IREE HAL
    design: buffers and views, synchronization primitives like semaphores,
    and command buffers. The intent is that if a device could implement the HAL
    interface the sequencer ops could run on that device, such as being able to
    run on a GPU via indirect command buffers.

    Though this is mostly a 1:1 mapping to the iree::hal API there are some
    methods omitted as they are not likely to be needed in IR. It's assumed that
    either sequencer interfaces will encapsulate the logic (such as device
    resolution) or that certain features are unsafe to expose to user-defined
    input.
