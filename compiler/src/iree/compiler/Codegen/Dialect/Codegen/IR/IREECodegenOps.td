    This op is implemented similarly to the upstream MemRef::ExtractStridedMetadataOp
    with the following differences.

    1. It does not fold away static offset/stride information.
    Hence unlike the upstream Op the link between the memref and consumers of the
    metadata is not broken when later passes change this information. A common
    example in IREE of this is buffer binding optimizations.

    2. Helper functions getConstifiedMixed{Offset|Strides|Sizes} are not implemented
    as the expectation is you should lower to the upstream op before using those
    functions if you need them.

    Copy of MemRef::ExtractStridedMetadataOp description for reference below.
    Extracts a base buffer, offset and strides. This op allows additional layers
    of transformations and foldings to be added as lowering progresses from
    higher-level dialect to lower-level dialects such as the LLVM dialect.

    The op requires a strided memref source operand. If the source operand is not
    a strided memref, then verification fails.

    This operation is also useful for completeness to the existing memref.dim op.
    While accessing strides, offsets and the base pointer independently is not
    available, this is useful for composing with its natural complement op:
    `memref.reinterpret_cast`.

    Intended Use Cases:

    The main use case is to expose the logic for manipulate memref metadata at a
    higher level than the LLVM dialect.
    This makes lowering more progressive and brings the following benefits:
      - not all users of MLIR want to lower to LLVM and the information to e.g.
        lower to library calls---like libxsmm---or to SPIR-V was not available.
      - foldings and canonicalizations can happen at a higher level in MLIR:
        before this op existed, lowering to LLVM would create large amounts of
        LLVMIR. Even when LLVM does a good job at folding the low-level IR from
        a performance perspective, it is unnecessarily opaque and inefficient to
        send unkempt IR to LLVM.
