// Struct describing the detailed subgroup-level layout of a MMA intrinsic.
// Together with element type information and subgroup size, it completes the
// full description of the semantics of a MMA intrinsic.
//
// Note: It is not possible to infer subgroup size from the information in this
// struct. The product of the `thread` sizes here is often, but not always equal
// to subgroup size. When the product of the `thread` sizes (call that product
// `P`) is smaller than subgroup size, it must be a divisor of it, and the
// semantics in that case are that threads within the subgroup whose thread-ids
// differ by a multiple of `P`, are accessing the same elements.
//
// Example observed in RDNA3 WMMA Wave32 intrinsics:
// If the subgroup size is 32 but the product `P` of `thread` sizes is 16, that
// means that each element is being accessed by 2 threads (2 = 32/16), and the
// threads accessing the same element are those whose tids are exactly 16 apart.

  // Internal dimensions (as in TileSwizzle::Dim::Kind::Internal) that are
  // outer-most in the layout. This happens when a MMA op, seen on a single
  // thread, has an operand that consists of multiple elements, and these elems
  // are NOT contiguous.
  // This is not used by every MMA op; ops which don't use that simply have 1's.
  SmallVector<int64_t, 2> outer;
  // Cross-thread dimensions (as in TileSwizzle::Dim::Kind::CrossThread).
  // This is the kind of dimension that is present in all GPU MMA ops, by

  // be 1, but not both.
